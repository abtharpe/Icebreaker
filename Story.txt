There once was a Hund from Deutschland.
He went to the biergarten in Rammstein.
The special of the day was a house-made apfelkuchen. Delicious.
He had never tasted a more scrumptious Gebaeck!
He asked the barman of the biergarten from where the delicious gebaeck had come, and the barman told him it was from the baeckerei at Schloss Eltz, so he set out at once to visit the baeckerei in person.
But first the hund had to get a small brot for his jurney.
After the hund procured the brot it was heading to the Flughafen.
On his drive there in his BMW, a Porsche became wettbewerbsfaehig.
They zoomed down Hauptstrasse, at each others necks the whole way.
Altough it was close, the brot gave the hund super powers and the hund got to the flughafen first.
Or so he thought, as his head collided with the Mehlhase's. No one beats a rabbit.
